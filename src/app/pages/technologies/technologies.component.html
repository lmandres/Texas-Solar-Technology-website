    <h3>Concentrated Solar Power</h3>
    <p>
        As explained by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA),
        concentrating solar power (CSP) plants user mirrors to
	concentrate the energy from the sun to drive traditional steam
	turbines or engines that create electricity.  The thermal
	energy concentrated in a CSP plant can be stored and used to
	produce electricity when it is needed, day or night.
